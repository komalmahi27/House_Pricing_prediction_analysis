# House_Pricing_prediction_analysis
In this project, I built a house price prediction model using Python to estimate property prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. The model was trained on a house pricing dataset using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.


## Key steps involved:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Feature Selection and Engineering

Model Training and Evaluation

Prediction of House Prices for New Data

This project showcases the application of machine learning in real estate analytics, helping stakeholders make data-driven pricing decisions.
