# House_Pricing_prediction_analysis
In this project, I built a house price prediction model using Python to estimate property prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. The model was trained on a house pricing dataset using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
